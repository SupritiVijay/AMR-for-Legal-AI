# AMR-for-Legal-AI

## Project goal
* Improving performance in legal MCQA using meaning representations (MRs)
* Improving fairness of legal tasks using MRs

## Learning goals
* Discuss various meaning representation frameworks like AMR, DRS
* Identify literature gaps in using MRs for legal tasks
* Implement NLP model architectures that use MR as intermediate representations
* Defining metrics for evaluation of accuracy and fairness for legal NLP tasks

## Overall plan
* Reproduce “Can AMR Assist Legal and Logical Reasoning?”
* Alternate architecture to be hierarchical
* Alternate framework to DRS
* Alternate dataset to another task, maybe with human characteristics (see https://github.com/mainlp/awesome-human-label-variation)
* Alternate evaluation to consider fairness
