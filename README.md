# AMR Evaluation for Legal Judgement Prediction

This repository contains various directories and Jupyter Notebook files for working with Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) tasks. Each directory focuses on a specific aspect of the AMR pipeline. Below is a brief overview of each directory:

## AMR-Parsing

The AMR-Parsing directory contains code and Jupyter notebooks for performing AMR parsing. You can find different notebooks for splitting techniques `before` and `after`. Please ensure that you configure the necessary paths in the notebooks before running them.

## AMR-Pretraining

The AMR-Pretraining directory includes code for pre-training AMR models using LegalBERT. It contains a Jupyter notebook, `pre-training-legalbert.ipynb`, which guides you through the process of pre-training LegalBERT using AMR data. Remember to modify the specified path in the notebook before running the code.

## AMR-finetuned-models

The AMR-finetuned-models directory provides Jupyter Notebook files for fine-tuning and using various models for AMR tasks. It offers notebooks for different models, such as DistilRoBERTa and LegalBERT. Instructions are provided within each notebook, including details on configuring paths and running the notebooks.

## Evaluation

The Evaluation directory contains notebooks for evaluating different models on specific datasets. It includes notebooks for evaluating DistilRoBERTa models and LegalBERT models. Detailed instructions are provided in the respective notebooks on how to load the models, set paths, and execute evaluation tasks.

Please navigate to the specific directories and refer to the README files within each directory for more detailed instructions on running the notebooks and performing the desired AMR tasks.
